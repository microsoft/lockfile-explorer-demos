This is a [Rush](https://rushjs.io) monorepo that uses the [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) package manager.

ðŸ‘‰ You must launch the Verdaccio service before installing; otherwise `rush install` will report `ECONNREFUSED` errors.

documentation for complete setup instructions, as well as explanations of each demo branch.
